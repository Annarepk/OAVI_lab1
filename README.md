_Color models and image resampling_

The following task was set:

### Color models
1. Select the R, G, and B components and save them as separate images.
2. Bring the image to the HSI color model, save the brightness
component as a separate image.
3. Invert the brightness component in the original image, save
the derived image.

### Oversampling
1. Stretching (interpolating) the image by M times;
2. Compression (decimation) of the image by N times;
3. Oversampling the image by K=M/N times by stretching and
then compressing (in two passes);
4. Oversampling the image K times in one pass.
